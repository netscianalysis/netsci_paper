This directory contains the scripts and data to carry out the generalized correlation analysis 
on the SERCA protein. All of the GC R_MI numpy arrays are stored in the data/ directory, 
with indpendent directories for the MD simulations triplicates. 

The notebook SERCA GC Analysis.ipynb containts the bulk of the analysis. The notebook pulls in 
functions and data from the analysis_scripts/ directory and the data/ directory. 
The average_struct.py script can read in an MD simulation and outputs a single structure based on the 
average position of the atoms. This structure is needed for the contact map analysis. 
The pathfinding_script.py is defines pathfinding function and classes used for the network 
analysis. It is meant to be imported as a module, rather than ran as a stand alone script. 

The run_scipts directory contains two scripts to carry out the GC analysis with netsci. 
run_simple_MI.py runs the algorithm using the local alignment algorithm. The script uses command line 
arguments to specify the MD simulation, number of frames, etc. 
The run_MI.sh is a bash script that calls the run_simple_MI.py script. It can be modified for submissions 
to high performance computing centers, or to run several GC MI calculations in batches. 





The following python packages are used in the analysis, in addition to the packages required 
for netsci: 

numpy 
mdtraj 
time
matplotlib 
networkx
seaborn
