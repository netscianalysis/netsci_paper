This directory contains scripts that run tests and benchmarks
using the Gaussian distributions. 

# Algorithm Sensitivity to Dataset Size Plot
In order to generate the
figure that shows the accuracy of Kraskov's algorithm
for different distribution covariances and different numbers
of sampled data points, one must first run the script:

```
python gaussian_computed_vs_exact_generate.py
```

That will probably take several days to complete. 

If you do not wish to wait until the entire calculations
finish, you may simply use the data we generated before
by renaming it:

```
mv gaussian_I2_minus_Iexact0.0_BACKUP.txt gaussian_I2_minus_Iexact0.0.txt
mv gaussian_I2_minus_Iexact0.3_BACKUP.txt gaussian_I2_minus_Iexact0.3.txt
mv gaussian_I2_minus_Iexact0.6_BACKUP.txt gaussian_I2_minus_Iexact0.6.txt
mv gaussian_I2_minus_Iexact0.9_BACKUP.txt gaussian_I2_minus_Iexact0.9.txt
```

Once that is done, the plot can be generated:

python gaussian_computed_vs_exact_plot.py

# Benchmark Plots
The benchmarks can be performed and plotted with the following
command:

python benchmark.py

Note that this will generate data for the computer's existing GPU
and CPU. The plotting script benchmark_plot_only.py will need to
be modified to read data from the produced benchmark data. The
data used in the publication already exists in this directory, and
will be plotted by default.

The plots can be generated with the following command:

python benchmark_plot_only.py

One may also generate the Bootstrap data and plots by running the following scripts:

python gaussian_computed_vs_exact_bootstrap.py

python gaussian_computed_vs_exact_distribution.py
